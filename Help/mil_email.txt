Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF). 
Military professionals lead their emails with a short, staccato statement known as the BLUF.
It declares the purpose of the email and action required. The BLUF should quickly answer the five W’s: 
who, what, where, when, and why. 
An effective BLUF distills the most important information for the reader. Here’s an example BLUF:

    BLUF: Effective 29 Oct 13, all Air Force Doctrine Documents (AFDDs) have been rescinded and 
replaced by core doctrine volumes and doctrine annexes.


Active voice
They also eschew the passive voice because it tends to make sentences longer, or as the Air Force 
manual puts it, “Besides lengthening and twisting sentences, passive verbs often muddy them.” 

Instead, use active voice, which puts nouns ahead of verbs, so it’s clear who is doing the action. 
By using active voice, you are making the “verbs do the work for you.” Instead of, “The factory was 
bombed by an F18,” military professionals would say, “An F18 bombed the factory.”
